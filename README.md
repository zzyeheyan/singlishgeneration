# In one phrase

Generate Singlish text messages with different models such as Markov Chain and Recurrent Neural Network.

# Abstract

Computational processing of text messages can be a challenging problem when we want the generated texts to make sense and display some creativity. In the domain of Singapore English specifically, we trained three models, including **Markov Chain**, **Bidirectional-LSTM**, **RNN model** with character tokenization and **RNN model** with word tokenization, to auto-generate Singlish-like text messages. Out of all models, the RNN model with word tokens performs the best from human evaluatorsâ€™ perspective and copy long phrases from the corpus less frequently.

# Structure

This repository includes 

* instructions from Professor Jackie Cheung,

* our codes, and

* our final report.

The codes are composed of the following:

* Text preprocessing
* Training
    - Markov chain model
    - Bidirectional-LSTM model
    - RNN model
* Evaluation
    - cardinality count
    - human assessment
* Other efforts
    - POS tagging


# Short note

This project is first done as the final project of course COMP 550 at McGill University, as a collaboration among three team members. The "Final Project Report" includes background, methodology, data, and analysis for the project.
