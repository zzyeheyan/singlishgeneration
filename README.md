# In one phrase

Singlish text message generation with different models such as Markov Chain and Recurrent Neural Network.

# Abstract

Computational processing of text messages can be a challenging problem when we want the generated texts to make sense and display a certain degree of creativity. In the domain of Singapore English specifically, we trained three models, including **Markov Chain**, **Bidirectional-LSTM**, **RNN model** with character tokenization and **RNN model** with word tokenizing, to auto-generate Singlish-like text messages. Out of all models, the RNN model with word tokens performs the best from human evaluatorsâ€™ perspective and copy long phrases from the corpus less frequently.

# Short note

This project is first done as the final project of course COMP 550 at McGill University, as a collaboration among three team members. The "Final Project Report" includes background, methodology, data, and analysis for the project.
